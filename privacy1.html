  <h1>Privacy Policy for TablePasteCheck</h1>

  <p>Effective Date: November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    TablePasteCheck is a local desktop utility application that helps users verify pasted data in spreadsheets or tables.
    The app is developed and distributed as part of the <strong>Phoenix Spaces</strong> tool ecosystem.
    This policy explains how your information is handled when you use TablePasteCheck.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    TablePasteCheck does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.  
    The app operates entirely on your local computer without connecting to the internet or external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Local File Access</h2>
  <p>
    When you open or paste data into TablePasteCheck, all processing happens locally on your device.  
    The app only accesses files or clipboard content that <strong>you explicitly choose or provide</strong>.  
    No information is automatically shared or uploaded anywhere.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    TablePasteCheck does not share any data with Phoenix Spaces, its developers, or any third parties.  
    There is no tracking, telemetry, analytics, or advertising within the app.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Internet Access</h2>
  <p>
    The app does not require an internet connection to function and does not send or receive any network requests.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security and User Control</h2>
  <p>
    Since all operations occur locally on your device, your data remains under your full control.  
    We recommend standard system security practices, such as using antivirus software and keeping your operating system up to date.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    If this application ever adds online functionality or changes how data is handled, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.  
    Any updates will be reflected in the published version on this page.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
